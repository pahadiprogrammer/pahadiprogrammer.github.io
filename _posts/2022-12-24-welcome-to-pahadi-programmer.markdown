This is the beginning of my blogging journey. I started working in IT companies as intern back in 2015 and converted fulltime from 2016. 2016 onwards I have range of experience starting with services and later product based companies.

Software development is more than just code. It involves whole set of activities around code and writing actual code is very small part. If you listen to experienced programmers then you will also learn - a good programmer writes code, a great programmer deletes it. When I heard it for the first time I was a beginner in programming and all I wanted is to write code. But as I gained experience I learned that code is a liability. If you write code you have to document it, monitor it, fix bugs in it. Isn't it better if there is no such work. 

Obviously if there is no code only then it's possible to not have activities around it and that means we software developers/engineers will be out of job which nobody wants. But then having too much of this is also bad as that means developers are engaged in operations and no feature development can occur.

Therefore, a balance is required between code, maintenance and new features.

I will be writing many blogs which share interesting bits about software development/emgineering. The idea is not to create a new Java blog or tech blog but a blog which can help others in software field to relate, learn from the info shared.
